# [NOT MAINTAINED]
# <a href="http://discord.app">Discord</a> Security Portal - DSP Bot
This project was made for <a href="https://blog.discordapp.com/discord-community-hack-week-build-and-create-alongside-us-6b2a7b7bba33">Discord's Hack Week (2019)</a>.

OH YEAAAAAAAAH
This is a portal with information on infractions commited by users on Discord's servers. A super duper ultra cool Bot (DSPBot) will register those infractions and send them to the portal.

# Portal :door:
You can acess the portal via this link: <a href="https://discord-security-portal.herokuapp.com">this link</a>.<br>
Also, check out this extra-rare <a href="https://github.com/saulojoab/Discord-Security-Portal/tree/webapp">portal's source code</a>. 

# The Bot :robot:
You can join <a href="https://discord.gg/8XxrcSG">this server</a> to test the bot. There aren't a lot of functions but it's easy to use and does the job.

## Commands:
### search
`=dsb search @user`<br>
Searches the server for all infractions that user has commited.

### infraction
`=dsb infraction @user reason`<br>
It reports an infraction from a user and saves it in the server.

### ban
`=dsb ban @user reason`<br>
Bans an user then creates an infraction report on the server.

### kick
`=dsb kick @user reason`<br>
Kicks an user then creates an infraction report on the server.

### say
`=dsb say message`<br>
Makes the bot say something ultra nice.

# Ok, what now? :thinking:
I might continue developing this service, I made it for studying purpouses <i>(also I really want a cool discord t-shirt and some stickers)</i> so yeah. Feel free to open an <a href="https://github.com/saulojoab/Discord-Security-Portal/issues">Issue</a> if you find anything weird. There might be lots of bugs.
